# Prompt Engineering

This project consists of a backend (`prompt-generator`) and a frontend (`ui-form`) designed to interact with the OpenAI API to generate a high-quality prompts based on user input.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

This will start the frontend on http://localhost:3000. The frontend provides a user interface for inputting data to generate prompts and display refined results.

### Usage

- Open your web browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- Use the form to enter details about the role, task, format, tone, audience, and scope.
- Submit the form to see the generated prompts and their refined versions.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
